    "# An introduction to the MM-GBSA method\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "The MM-GBSA (and related MM-PBSA) methoda are popular approches to the prediction of ligand-receptor binding free energies. They typically give better predictions than simple docking approaches, and though not as sophisticated as Free Energy Perturbation methods, are considerably less compute-intensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a good review, see: [Genheden and Ryde](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1517/17460441.2015.1032936#d1e147).\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the MM-GBSA method can be used to post=process an MD simulation of a receptor-ligand complex and extract a predicted binding free energy. The steps are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Three further simulation systems are parameterized, as if for implicit solvent simulations:\n",
    "    1. The complex (receptor + ligand, no explicit ions or solvent)\n",
    "    2. The receptor alone.\n",
    "    3. The ligand alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. For each snapshot from the original simulation:\n",
    "   1. The coordinates of the complex atoms alone are extracted, and the energy of this conformation, $Ec$, calculated using the implicit solvent model for the complex.\n",
    "   2. The coordinates of the receptor atoms alone are extracted, and their energy $Er$ calculated using the implicit solvent model of the receptor.\n",
    "   3. The coordinates of the ligand atoms alone are extracted, and their energy $El$ calculated using the implicit solvent model of the ligand.\n",
    "   4. The binding energy between the receptor and ligand, $Ei$, is then given by $Ec - (Er + El)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The binding free energy is then approximated as $\\langle Ei \\rangle$.\n",
