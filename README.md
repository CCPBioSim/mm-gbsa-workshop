# The MM-GBSA method for the estimation of receptor-ligand binding free energies.

This workshop walks through the process of perfprming a basic MM-GBSA analysis
of a molecular dynamics simulation of a protein-ligand complex to estimate
the ligand binding free energy. The approach here uses *OpenMM* with a little help from *ParmEd*. 

The example here uses data from a simulation performed using *OpenMM*, but could readily be adapted for use with simulations run with *Amber* or *GROMACS* (and maybe *CHARMM*).

## Installation

The simplest way to run the workshop on your own laptop/workstation is to clone this repository and execute the supplied `run_notebook.sh` script.
